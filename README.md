# SQLIA-Detection-ML
A machine Learning approach for SQL injection attack detection

The solution imparts creation of an AI/ML model meticulously trained on a diverse set of SQL injection attacks. 
The model employs the tokenization of queries and analyzes the number of occurrences of certain tokens in the queries to detect potential malicious queries.
The model used exploratory data analysis (EDA), for the selection of relevant features and uses Random Forest for query prediction.
Real-time query data is then imported into the model, allowing for on-the-fly indication of  whether a given query exhibits characteristics associated with potential security threats.
